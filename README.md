Welcome to my digital space! 🌐 I’m a graduate student at **Illinois Institute of Technology** with a passion for **Data Science** and **AI**, working on turning raw data into stories, insights, and impact. Here, you’ll find a glimpse of my journey in tech, sprinkled with a bit of creativity and curiosity!

## 🚀 My Mission

I’m on a mission to bring data to life, whether it's by tackling traffic congestion with IoT or enhancing road safety using sensor tech. I believe in data's power to make the world a better, smarter place — and I’m constantly exploring new ways to make that happen.

## 🎓 Education & Adventure

📚 **Master's in Information Technology and Management**  
🏫 *Illinois Institute of Technology* — Chicago, IL  
*Expected Graduation*: Dec 2026

🎓 **Bachelor’s in Civil Engineering**  
🏛️ *B V Raju Institute of Technology* — Hyderabad, India

Why the switch from Civil Engineering to Data Science? Because I found my passion at the intersection of **technology** and **real-world impact**. Plus, moving from India to Chicago was an adventure of its own — I’ve learned so much from both experiences!

## 🔧 Skills at a Glance

Rather than a plain list, here’s what I’m good at and love working with:

- **Languages & Frameworks**: Python 🐍, R 📊, Java ☕, and a splash of JavaScript
- **Data Magic**: Pandas, NumPy, MySQL, Power BI, Apache Spark ⚡
- **Cloud & More**: Microsoft Azure ☁️, Arduino for IoT projects, and OpenCV for image processing

But my favorite skill? **Problem-solving.** There's nothing quite like cracking a complex challenge with a cup of coffee and some creative thinking.

## 🌱 Outside of Work

When I’m not coding, you’ll likely find me exploring new places around Chicago, reading up on AI trends, or tinkering with my camera to capture the city’s beautiful skyline.

I love going on solo dates, giving myself some me-time, exploring the city, and having new interactions.

**Fun fact about me:** I chew ice as if it's chicken tenders. 😄
